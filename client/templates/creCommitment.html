		RE:	Commercial Mortgage Loan to [Borrower’s name or names]
			in the amount of $[Loan Amount]

Dear Mr. [Borrower or entity officer listed above]:

	Ocean Bank (“Bank” or “Lender”) has considered your request for financing and is pleased to inform you that the Bank has agreed to make available to Borrower a commercial mortgage loan (“Loan”) upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth (“Commitment” or “Commitment Letter”).

1. Borrower:	[Borrower name or names with type of entity and state of formation, if applicable] 
	
2. Amount:	The amount of the Loan will be the lower of: (i) [the loan amount in words] Dollars ($[the loan amount in numbers]); or (ii) seventy five percent (75%) [percentage may vary] of the reviewed “As Is” appraised value of the Property (defined below); or (iii) the maximum amount that will still allow the Property to satisfy a minimum debt service coverage ratio of _____ to 1, as determine in accordance with the financial covenant paragraph below.

3. Purpose:	The purpose of the Loan is to [use purpose stated in the CAS. Modify the description as may be appropriate.] 

4. Guarantor:	Repayment of the Loan and all other obligations of Borrower to Bank set forth in the Loan Documents (as defined below) will be unconditionally jointly and severally guaranteed by [names of guarantors], each in their individual capacity  (together, “Guarantors”).   Additionally, throughout the term of the Loan, any other individual and/or entity owning, directly or indirectly, fifteen percent (15%) or more of Borrower’s ownership interests shall be required to guaranty the Loan.  At all times, a minimum of 51% of the ownership interests must guaranty the Loan and must have full control over the Borrower. Each guarantor will unconditionally guaranty repayment of the Loan and all other obligations of Borrower to Bank set forth in the Loan Documents (as defined below).

5. Term:		The Loan will be for a term of [in words] ([numerical]) years from the Closing Date. 

6. Interest Rate:  	The rate of interest on the Loan will be fixed for the initial [spelled out] ([numerical]) years at an initial rate of [spelled out] percent per annum ([numerical]%).  On the [fifth and tenth] anniversary of the Loan (each an “Adjustment Date”), the rate of interest on the Loan shall be recalculated by Bank to a fixed rate of interest equal to the then current Wall Street Journal Prime Rate Index, plus [one and one half percent] (1.50%) per annum. The interest rate applicable to the Loan, as adjusted from time to time, is hereinafter referred to as the “Applicable Interest Rate”.  In no event shall the Applicable Interest Rate at any time be less than four and three quarters percent (4.75%) per annum (the “Floor Rate”). Interest on the Loan will be calculated for the actual number of days which have elapsed on the basis of a 360 day year and shall be payable in arrears.
			
7. Repayment:	Monthly installments of principal and interest shall be payable on the 30th day after the Closing Date and on the same day of each month thereafter (each a “Payment Date”) in an amount equal to the sum required to repay the Loan in full amortized over a twenty-five (25) year straight mortgage amortization (the “Amortization Period”), in substantially equal monthly payments.  To the extent that the Applicable Interest Rate changes on an Adjustment Date, the monthly installments of principal and interest payable shall be adjusted by Bank to an amount that would cause the unpaid principal balance of the Loan as of the Adjustment Date to be amortized over the remaining Amortization Period at then Applicable Interest Rate. Any remaining unpaid principal balance, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums due under this Loan shall be due and payable on the maturity date.

8. Commitment 
Fee:		Borrower will pay to Bank a nonrefundable commitment fee in an amount equal to one half of one percent (.50%) of the Loan amount (the “Commitment Fee”). The Commitment Fee shall be considered earned upon acceptance of this Commitment Letter and will be paid to Bank by Borrower as follows: (i) one-half of the Commitment Fee at the time of execution by Borrower of this Commitment Letter; and (ii) the balance at the earlier of the Loan closing or the expiration or termination of this Commitment Letter.  Borrower acknowledges that the Commitment Fee is a liquidated damages amount and is reasonable compensation to Bank for the loss of other investment opportunities by reason of allocating the Loan amount for the commitment period.  In addition to the Commitment Fee, Borrower shall pay an underwriting fee of $500 to Bank at the closing of the Loan.

9. Default 
Interest:	From and after the maturity date of the Loan and during the continuation of any default, the Loan will, at Bank's option, bear interest at the maximum rate of interest permitted under Florida law.  In addition, if any payment of principal or interest is not received by Bank within ten (10) days after its due date, the interest rate in effect on the Loan will be increased to the maximum permitted by law and shall remain at said rate until all amounts that are due are paid.
			
10. Pre-Payment 
Penalty:   		The loan may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty.  

11. Collateral:	Borrower’s obligations to repay the Loan will be secured by the following real and personal property (collectively, “Collateral”) and the security interests shall be evidenced as follows:

11.1  A valid first lien mortgage on the real property (more particularly described in Exhibit “1” attached), and the improvements now or hereafter constructed thereon (“Property”); (existing mortgages on the Property, if any, must be paid off, closed (if a line of credit), and satisfied);

			11.2  An absolute assignment of leases and rents providing for the assignment to Bank by Borrower of all leases and rents relating to the Property; and

11.3 A perfected first lien security interest in all fixtures, furniture, equipment, books and records and all other personal property of Borrower located at or used in connection with the Property.

12. Leases:	If the Property is to be rented, Borrower shall deliver to Bank executed copies of all leases for the Property prior to the Loan closing, in each instance in form and substance satisfactory to Bank.  All leases must be in writing, subordinate to the lien of the Bank’s mortgage, and contain terms and conditions acceptable to Bank.  In the event any lease is not self-subordinating, Borrower shall deliver to Bank a subordination agreement in form and content required by Bank from each tenant under such non-self-subordinating lease(s). Bank reserves the right, but initially may not require, estoppel letters from each tenant noted on the Rent Roll (defined below).

13.  Reporting

14. Covenants:  	In addition to such affirmative and negative covenants as are typically required by Bank, the Loan Documents will contain the following additional covenants:

14.1  Deposit Accounts.  Borrower agrees to maintain their primary operating accounts at Bank during the term of the Loan.

		14.2 Debt Service Coverage Ratio; LTV.  Borrower shall maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.30 to 1 (“Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio” or “Required Debt Service Coverage Ratio”) throughout the term of the Loan.  “Debt Service Coverage Ratio” (also, “DSCR”) means Net Operating Income of the Property for the period in question divided by the aggregate principal and interest payable on the Loan for the same period.  “Net Operating Income” means all actual income from the Property minus ordinary operating expenses (based on the actual fiscal year-end income and expenses statements for the Property approved by Bank). In determining the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Bank shall utilize an assumed four percent (4.00%) management fee (or such greater management fee actually payable), and a two percent (2.00%) reserve for capital repairs and replacements. In the event that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below the Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio for any reporting period, Borrower shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days cure such event, as directed by Bank, by: (i) pledging additional collateral, acceptable to Bank in its sole and absolute discretion, as necessary to achieve the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio, (ii) obtain one or more replacement tenants whose rental payments are sufficient to cause the Property to again satisfy the Required Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and/or (iii) reducing the outstanding Loan amount necessary to achieve the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio.

		Additionally, in the event the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below the Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio during any reporting period after the DSCR Initial Compliance Date, Bank shall have the right to obtain a new appraisal of the Property prepared at Borrower’s sole expense by an appraiser acceptable to Bank.  In the event that the appraised value of the Property (as determined by Bank after reviewing the new appraisal report(s)) results in the outstanding Loan balance exceeding seventy five percent (75%) of the appraised value of the Property (“Required LTV”), the Borrower will have one hundred twenty (120) days to pledge additional cash collateral acceptable to the Bank or make a principal repayment in an amount necessary to achieve and maintain the Required LTV.

		14.3  Tax and Insurance Escrow. [During the term of the Loan, Borrower shall provide Bank with evidence of payment of all real estate taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the Property.] OR [During the term of the Loan, Borrower shall pay to the Bank, concurrently with the monthly payment of principal and interest, equal monthly installments which are sufficient to pay: (a) all real estate taxes on the Property by November of each year in which such taxes are billed on the Property; and (b) the annual insurance premiums for the required insurance on the Property.  Bank shall hold amounts so paid in a non-interest bearing account, and, provided Borrower has made sufficient payments, Bank shall pay the tax amount to the taxing authorities, at any time when due and Bank shall pay the annual insurance premium when due.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank shall at all times have the right, after a default by Borrower, to apply such funds to the obligations of the Loan as the Bank deems appropriate.]

 		14.4 Restriction on change of ownership and further encumbrances.  So long as this commitment or any part of the Loan is outstanding, the Property shall remain free and clear of all other encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interest and secondary financing, and Borrower shall not, without prior written consent of Bank, sell, transfer, encumber or convey all or any part of its interest in the Property or any portion thereof.  Additionally, any change, directly or indirectly, in the shareholder, trust beneficiary, or equity ownership of any Borrower or change in the ownership structure of a Borrower or other breach of the foregoing shall constitute a default under the Loan Documents, and if prior to closing, shall constitute grounds for terminating this Commitment Letter.  In the event Bank consents to any change in ownership structure of a Borrower, any individual and/or entity which owns, directly or indirectly, fifteen percent (15%) or more of the direct or indirect ownership interests in Borrower shall be required to guarantee the repayment of the Loan and the performance of all other obligations of Borrower to Bank set forth in the Loan Documents.  In the event of a Bank permitted change in the ownership structure of Borrower, a minimum of 51% of the ownership interests of Borrower must guaranty the Loan and must have full control over Borrower.
		
		14.5  Full Condition Report. Borrower shall provide Bank with a satisfactory full property condition and structural report (inclusive of roof and termite inspections and, if applicable, 40-year recertification) for each of the buildings in connection with the Property performed by a qualified engineer reasonably acceptable to Bank, which report shall be in form and substance acceptable to Bank in its sole discretion.  Bank shall have the right to withdraw this Commitment Letter in the event that the report discloses any physical condition not acceptable to Bank in its sole and absolute discretion.

14.6  Reserved. 

14.7  No Mezzanine Financing; Subordination of Debt.  Neither Borrower nor its constituents shall obtain any mezzanine or other secondary financing.  Any loans between members of Borrower and Borrower (if permitted by Bank) shall be subordinate in all respects with the repayment of the Loan.  

14.8  Sales or Participations.  Bank may from time to time sell or assign, in whole or in part, or grant participations in, the Loan.  The holder of any such sale, assignment or participation, if the applicable agreement between Bank and such holder so provides, shall be: (a) entitled to all of the rights, obligations and benefits of Bank; and (b) deemed to hold and may exercise the rights of setoff or banker's lien with respect to any and all obligations of such holder to Borrower, in each case as fully as though Borrower was directly indebted to such holder.  Bank may in its discretion give notice to Borrower of such sale, assignment or participation; however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect any of Bank's or such holder's rights hereunder.

14.9  Individual Obligation Waivers.  The Note or other Loan documents shall contain certain individual obligation waivers (surety waivers or guarantor waivers), including but not limited to, waivers of promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor, impairment of collateral, release of co-obligors, and any other notice with respect to any of defenses, unless, and only to the extent that such defenses are expressly granted to Borrower by the Loan documents.

		19.8  Waiver of Rights of Bank.

20.	Background, Credit Investigation, and Money Laundering:

			The Bank's obligation to make the Loan is subject to satisfactory business rating, credit rating reports and personal references/background checks on the Borrower and Guarantor.  During the term of the Loan, the Bank may update such information from time to time, as required by the USA Patriot Act, and as more particularly described in 31 C.F.R. 103.121 (the “Patriot Act”).  Borrower and Guarantor represents to Bank that each is in compliance with any and all applicable provisions of the Patriot Act and will remain in compliance throughout the term of the Loan.  To the best of Borrower's and Guarantor's knowledge, after making due inquiry, neither Borrower, Guarantor nor any person providing funds to Borrower or Guarantor is under investigation by any governmental authority for, or has been charged with, or convicted of, money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorist related activities, any crimes which in the United States would be predicate crimes to money laundering, or any violation of any Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term “Anti-Money Laundering Laws” shall mean laws, regulations and sanctions, state and federal, criminal and civil, that (a) limit the use of and/or seek the forfeiture of proceeds from illegal transactions; (b) limit commercial transactions with designated countries or individuals believed to be terrorists, narcotics dealers or otherwise engaged in activities contrary to the interests of the United States; (c) require identification and documentation of the parties with whom a financial institution conducts business; or (d) are designated to disrupt the flow of funds to terrorist organizations.  Such laws, regulations and sanctions shall be deemed to include the Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et. seq., the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. App. Section 1 et. seq., the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. Section 1701 et. seq., and the sanction regulations promulgated pursuant thereto by the OFAC as well as laws relating to prevention and detection of money laundering in 18 U.S.C. Sections 1956 and 1957.

21.  Compliance:	Bank's obligations under this Commitment Letter are subject to the requirements of the supervisory authorities regulating the Bank, and all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those related to lending limits.

Borrower agrees that Bank shall have no liability whatsoever to Borrower or any third party, including any intended or incidental beneficiary hereof, as a result of any such conflict, and Borrower shall indemnify and exculpate Bank from all liabilities, costs and attorneys' fees resulting from any such conflict.

22.  Damages:	Under no circumstances shall Bank (or the parent companies and affiliates of Bank, and its members, shareholders, officers, directors, agents and employees) be liable to Borrower or Guarantor (or their respective parent companies and affiliates, and their respective members, shareholders, officers, directors, agents and employees) for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary or punitive damages (including, without limitation, loss of actual or anticipated profits, revenues or product; increased expense of borrowing or financing; and increased cost of capital) arising out of this Commitment; and, regardless of whether any such claim arises out of breach of contract, guarantee or warranty, tort, product liability, indemnity, contribution, strict liability or any other legal theory.
